I'm interested in exploring code as a conventional artistic expression. It's often useful to know a subject well when trying to express it as art, so I thought I might as well start with something I know pretty well: me.

# Operating Instructions

Open a Ruby REPL (like irb), and load 'me.rb', then go nuts. Don't forget: I'm one of a kind!

```ruby
me = Me.instance
me.tweets
```
